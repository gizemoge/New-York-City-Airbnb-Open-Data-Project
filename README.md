This project explores the New York City Airbnb dataset, identifying patterns in pricing, availability, and spatial distribution. Techniques like data preprocessing, z-score outlier detection, and imputation were used to refine the dataset for analysis. Advanced visualizations (Seaborn, Matplotlib) are employed to illustrate trends and distributions, while statistical groupings uncovered insights specific to various neighborhoods.
